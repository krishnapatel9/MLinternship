🟡 Time Series Forecasting (Week 19)
📌 Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting, a technique used to analyze and predict values that change over time. The goal is to understand patterns such as
trends and seasonality, and use forecasting models to predict future values based on historical data.The project uses the Air Passenger dataset as a real-world 
example.

📊 What is Time Series Data?
Time series data consists of observations recorded at regular time intervals (monthly, daily, yearly, etc.).

Key characteristics:
Observations are time-dependent
Order of data matters
Past values influence future values
Examples include sales data, stock prices, website traffic, and passenger counts.

🔍 Components of a Time Series
Trend:The long-term upward or downward movement in data over time.
Seasonality:Regular patterns that repeat at fixed intervals (e.g., monthly or yearly patterns).
Noise:Random fluctuations that cannot be explained by trend or seasonality.

Understanding these components helps in selecting the right forecasting model.
📈 Data Visualization
Visualizing time series data helps identify:
Overall growth or decline
Seasonal patterns
Sudden changes or anomalies
Plotting the data is a critical first step before modeling.

🧠 ARIMA Model
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical forecasting model used for time series data.
Key ideas:
Uses past values and past errors to predict future values
Handles trends and seasonality
Works best for stable and structured time series
Auto ARIMA automatically selects the best model parameters.

🔮 Prophet Model
Prophet is a time series forecasting model developed by Facebook designed for business use cases.
Key features:
Automatically detects trend and seasonality
Handles missing data and outliers well
Provides interpretable components such as trend and yearly patterns
It is user-friendly and effective for real-world forecasting problems.

📉 Forecast vs Actual Comparison
Forecasted values are compared with actual data to:
Measure prediction accuracy
Understand model performance
Identify overfitting or underfitting
This comparison is essential for validating forecasting models.

📏 Model Evaluation
Forecast accuracy is evaluated using:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – average prediction error
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – penalizes larger errors
Lower values indicate better performance.

🔄 Model Comparison
Both ARIMA and Prophet are applied to the same dataset and compared to:
Understand strengths and weaknesses
Select the most suitable model for the problem

🎯 Key Takeaways
Time series data requires special handling due to time dependency
Visualization helps reveal trends and seasonality
ARIMA is strong for statistical forecasting
Prophet is flexible and business-friendly
Model evaluation ensures reliable forecasts
