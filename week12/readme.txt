Week 12: Capstone Computer Vision Project
Objective
The culmination of all previous computer vision learning — building and deploying a complete end-to-end CV project.
You apply everything from image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to real-time inference and deployment.

Learning Goals
Apply all concepts from earlier CV modules in a practical project.
Develop a Face Mask Detector or Hand Gesture Classifier using a modern deep learning workflow.
Gain hands-on experience in data collection, annotation, model training, evaluation, and real-world deployment.
Understand how to evaluate models using accuracy or mean Average Precision (mAP).

 Key Stages
1.Define the Project Scope
Hand Gesture Classification → identify gestures like “thumbs up” or “peace”.
The problem definition sets your model type — object detection (YOLO) or image classification (CNN).

2.Dataset Collection & Annotation
Annotate them using Roboflow, ensuring clean bounding boxes or labels.
Export dataset in YOLOv8 (for detection) or classification format (for CNN).

Core Skill Learned:
→ Understanding dataset formats and annotation pipelines in real-world ML tasks.

3.Model Training
For object detection: Train using YOLOv8.
For classification: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on previous weeks.

Core Skill Learned:
→ Model architecture understanding, loss functions, hyperparameter tuning, and handling overfitting through augmentation.

4.Evaluation & Validation
Evaluate model performance:
YOLOv8: mean Average Precision (mAP)
CNN: classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Target at least 85% accuracy or reasonable detection performance.

Core Skill Learned:
→ Interpreting model metrics and validating model robustness.
5. Real-Time Inference
Use webcam or uploaded images to:
Perform real-time detection/classification.
Display annotated predictions using OpenCV or Colab visualization.
Core Skill Learned:
→ Bridging trained models with deployment-ready applications.

6.Documentation & Reporting
Prepare a complete project report including:
Problem statement
Dataset source & preparation
training configuration
Evaluation results (graphs, confusion matrix, sample outputs)
Example predictions or demo screenshots
Core Skill Learned:
→ Writing reproducible research-style documentation for ML projects.

                                                                   
Crucial Topics Reinforced
End-to-End ML workflow (Data → Model → Evaluation → Deployment)
Model generalization and validation
Dataset annotation and management (Roboflow integration)

YOLOv8 pipeline (training, testing, inference)
