1. Understanding Transfer Learning Fundamentals
What I Learned:
Transfer learning allows us to use knowledge from large-scale datasets (like ImageNet) on smaller, domain-specific problems
Pre-trained models provide excellent feature extractors that can be fine-tuned for new tasks
This approach is particularly valuable when working with limited data resources

Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Feature Reusability: Leveraging learned features from pre-trained models
Domain Adaptation: Adapting models trained on general datasets to specific tasks
Parameter Efficiency: Reducing training time and computational resources

2. Model Architecture Modification
What I Learned:
How to modify pre-trained model architectures for new tasks
The importance of adapting the final classification layer to match the number of target classes
Techniques for handling different input sizes between pre-training and target domains

3. Layer Freezing Strategies
What I Learned:
Early Layer Freezing: Lower-level features (edges, textures) are generally transferable across domains
Fine-tuning Final Layers: Higher-level features need adaptation for specific tasks
Selective Unfreezing: Strategic approach to which layers should be trainable

Implementation Strategy:
Froze all convolutional layers to preserve learned features
Unfroze only the final fully connected layer for task-specific adaptation
This approach prevents overfitting while allowing necessary adaptation

4. Training Configuration for Transfer Learning
What I Learned:
Lower learning rates are typically used for fine-tuning to avoid disrupting pre-trained features
Different optimization strategies for frozen vs. trainable parameters
Importance of learning rate scheduling during fine-tuning

Optimization Approach:
Used Adam optimizer with reduced learning rate (0.001)
Applied learning rate scheduling to gradually reduce learning rate
Optimized only the unfrozen parameters to maintain feature stability

5. Performance Evaluation and Analysis
What I Learned:
How to interpret training curves for transfer learning scenarios
The importance of validation metrics in detecting overfitting
Effective use of confusion matrices for binary classification evaluation

Evaluation Metrics Tracked:
Training and validation loss curves
Accuracy progression over epochs
Confusion matrix analysis
Classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score.
