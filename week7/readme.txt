Week 7: Regularization & Hyperparameter Tuning with PyTorch
ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
1. Understanding Regularization Techniques
Key Concepts:
Dropout: A regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting
Batch Normalization: A method that normalizes layer inputs to reduce internal covariate shift and accelerate training
Overfitting: When a model learns training data too well but fails to generalize to unseen data

What I Learned:
I implemented and compared three different CNN architectures:
Base CNN: A standard convolutional neural network without regularization
CNN with Dropout: Incorporates dropout layers to prevent overfitting
CNN with Batch Normalization: Uses batch normalization to stabilize and accelerate training
The results showed that both regularization techniques improved validation performance compared to the base model,
with batch normalization providing the most significant benefits.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search
Key Concepts:
Grid Search: A method for hyperparameter optimization that exhaustively tries all combinations of specified parameters
Learning Rate: Controls how much to update model weights during training
Batch Size: Number of training examples used in one iteration
Optimizer Selection: Algorithm used to update model parameters (SGD vs. Adam)

What I Learned:
I performed a comprehensive grid search over:
Batch sizes: [32, 64]
Learning rates: [0.001, 0.01]
Optimizers: [SGD, Adam]
The results demonstrated that optimal hyperparameters can significantly impact model performance, with Adam optimizer generally outperforming 
SGD and smaller learning rates often providing more stable training.

3. Model Evaluation and Comparison
Key Concepts:
Training vs Validation Loss: Monitoring both to detect overfitting
Generalization: Model's ability to perform well on unseen data
Visualization: Using plots to compare model performance across different configurations
What I Learned:
By visualizing training curves and validation metrics, I gained insights into how different regularization techniques affect the learning 
process. Dropout helped reduce the gap between training and validation performance, while batch normalization accelerated convergence and 
improved final accuracy.

ðŸš€ Implementation Details
Model Architectures
Base CNN: Simple convolutional network with two convolutional layers and two fully connected layers
CNN with Dropout: Same as Base CNN but with dropout (p=0.5) applied after the first fully connected layer
CNN with Batch Normalization: Incorporates batch normalization after each convolutional layer

Hyperparameter Tuning
A systematic grid search was conducted to find the optimal combination of:
Batch size: 32 vs 64
Learning rate: 0.001 vs 0.01
Optimizer: SGD vs Adam
Evaluation Metrics
Training loss
Validation loss
Validation accuracy
Test accuracy

ðŸ“Š Results and Findings
Regularization Techniques
Dropout: Reduced overfitting but slightly slowed convergence
Batch Normalization: Accelerated training and improved final accuracy
Combined Approach: The best results came from using both techniques together
Optimal Hyperparameters
After extensive testing, the optimal configuration was:
Batch Size: 64
Learning Rate: 0.001
Optimizer: Adam
Regularization: Batch Normalization + Dropout

This combination achieved the highest validation accuracy while maintaining good generalization to the test set.
